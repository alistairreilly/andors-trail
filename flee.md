# How to flee a fight #
When engaging combat with a tough monster, sometimes the best action is to flee and return later when you have built up your character and equipment more.
This is an explanation of how to flee:
  1. Engage in combat by attacking a monster, or wait until it's your time to start your attack turn.
  1. Select a square to move to that doesn't have any monster on it.
  1. **Longclick that square.**
  1. Notice how the square lights up yellow, thus indicating that you have selected it.
  1. Also notice that the "Attack" button has changed to a "Move" button.
  1. Click the screen (or click the Move button) to move to that square.
  1. Hopefully, you should now be in a square that doesn't have any monster adjacent to it.
  1. Click the screen (or click "End combat") to end combat.
  1. Combat ends. You have fled the fight.
  1. Make sure to kill that bastard later :)

Note that longclicking an adjacent square also allows you to select a different monster to attack.
