## Selling & buying items ##
The merchants that are available in the game sell very useful equipment. They also buy most items, except those items that are quest related.
When trading, each item has a _base cost_, but you trade at a 15% disadvantage to the base cost. This means that items that you buy are 15% more expensive than the base cost, and you sell for 15% less than the base cost.
