# Forums and issue tracker #

The forums can be found at: http://andorstrail.com/

The forums is probably the first place you want to go to to discuss things about the game.

This project page (here on code.google.com) also contains an issue tracker, that is meant for things that are prioritized to be included in future releases.

In summary, the forums are for:
  * Gameplay discussions
  * Questions
  * Help with solving quests
  * Discussions on what type of improvements the game should have in the future
  * Discussions of dates and content for future releases


And the issue tracker is for:
  * Prioritized things that are likely to be implemented in a future release
  * Bugs
